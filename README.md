# VMWare Launch ML/AI
This is the course page for a 3-day intensive workshop for the ML/AI pillar of the VMWare Launch program and culminates in a hackathon.

# Objectives
After this course, students will be able to:

- Explain what machine learning is and how it works
- Write Python code for the purpose of data analysis or machine learning
- Use the Pandas library for data wrangling 
- Build supervised learning (predictive) models in scikit-learn
- Use basic techniques to "tune" the models for better performance
- Explain what reinforcement learning and neural networks are
- Execute the machine learning workflow start-to-finish

# Agenda
The workshop is broken down into three days of training

## Day 1: Basic Model Building
1. [30 min] Overview of Machine Learning (ML) ([slides](https://github.com/suneel0101/ml-ai-vmware-launch/blob/master/Day%201/DI_Overview_of_ML.key))
2. [2 hrs] Practical Python for ML ([notebook](https://github.com/suneel0101/ml-ai-vmware-launch/blob/master/Day%201/Practical%20Python%20for%20ML.ipynb))
3. [2 hrs] Practical Pandas for data wrangling([notebook](https://github.com/suneel0101/ml-ai-vmware-launch/blob/master/Day%201/Practical%20Pandas%20for%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb))
4. [1.5 hrs] Building machine learning models ([notebook](https://github.com/suneel0101/ml-ai-vmware-launch/blob/master/Day%201/Building%20Models.ipynb))

## Day 2: Tuning, Neural Nets, RL & Hackathon
1. [1.5 hrs] Applying models and Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning (RL) ([notebook](https://github.com/suneel0101/ml-ai-vmware-launch/blob/master/Day%202/ML%20Practice%2C%20Neural%20Nets%2C%20and%20RL.ipynb))
2. [1 hr] Data Munging & Feature Engineering Practice ([notebook](https://github.com/suneel0101/ml-ai-vmware-launch/blob/master/Day%202/Data%20Munging%20Practice.ipynb))
