# Launch ML/AI [VWMare]
This is the course page for a 3-day intensive workshop for the ML/AI pillar of the VMWare Launch program and culminates in a hackathon.


# Objectives
After this course, students will be able to:

- Explain what machine learning is and how it works
- Write Python code for the purpose of data analysis or machine learning
- Use the Pandas library for data wrangling 
- Build supervised learning (predictive) models in scikit-learn
- Use basic techniques to "tune" the models for better performance
- Explain what reinforcement learning and neural networks are
- Use neural network libraries to a basic level
- Execute the machine learning workflow start-to-finish
